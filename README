# @iammati/git-ai

This AI-powered tool, based on Node.js, will help you summarizing changes done in a Git repository by analzying
diffs / code changes and using [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to do that.

## Why? AI.

I was lazy going through all my changes everytime and pull something together for a commit message. I wanted to have a tool that does that for me.

## Requirements

You need a OpenAI API Key to use this tool. You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @iammati/git-ai
```

## Usage

Just run the `git-ai` command in a Git repository where you added files into your staged-area and want to summarize a commit message for:

```bash
git-ai
```

Copy n paste the response into your commit message and you're done!
